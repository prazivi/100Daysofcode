Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge! This is a personal challenge that I have set for myself to commit to coding every day for the next 100 days. The goal of this challenge is to improve my coding skills, build projects, and develop the discipline to code consistently.

Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to push myself to become a better programmer by dedicating myself to coding every day. By committing to coding for 100 consecutive days, I hope to achieve the following:

Improve my coding skills
Learn new programming languages and frameworks
Build projects to add to my portfolio
Develop the habit of coding consistently
Connect with other developers who are also participating in the challenge
Rules
The rules for this challenge are simple:

Code for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days

Log my progress and any insights or challenges in a daily log file
Encourage and support other developers who are participating in the challenge
Tracking my progress
I will be tracking my progress on GitHub, where I will log my daily progress in a Markdown file. Each day, I will write a brief update about what I worked on, what I learned, and any challenges I faced. I will also tweet about my progress every day using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.

Conclusion
I am excited to start this challenge and commit to coding every day for the next 100 days. By the end of the challenge, I hope to have improved my coding skills, built some interesting projects, and developed the discipline to code consistently.
